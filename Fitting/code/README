Greetings,

This code gets the best-fit values of an input file located in the folder in/

At the moment, it takes the file 'in/DecayTimesData.txt'.

To run the code type: 

$ bash run.sh

For it to work, an installation of python3 is required. Dependencies such as numpy, scipy and matplotlib should be
installed when typing the mentioned command. 

The code creates a virtual environment called Fitting. To access it, type:

$ . Fitting/bin/activate

The code is in three files: 

ML_NLL.py - which, when run alone gets the best-fit parameters of the 'in/DecayTimesData.txt' data.

MCsim.py - where a python class is setup to create Monte Carlo simulations using the best-fit parameters determined in ML_NLL.py

run_dmc.py - when run starts 500 Monte Carlo simulations, each with 10.000 decay times.
