\begin{abstract}
 This report outlines a proposed procedure for synchronising lines of an image that has been corrupted by randomly shifting horizontal lines. The method involves the use of discrete fourier transforms of each line in the given image to determine to what degree each of them was shifted. The end result of the procedure is an image that has been reconstructed to an almost perfect extent.
